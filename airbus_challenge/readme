(c) Airbus Embedded Security Challenge

-- Scenario --

You are a foreign country spy trying to attack BigCorp Labs physical
security. As of today, your infiltrated agents can't access restricted
area offices. Their user certificate is unprivileged, they need a
"group=admin" certificate !

One of your agents has found a engineer usb stick with interesting
documents on it. He sent you an email.

Your goal is to try to hack into the authentication server responsible
for delivering certificates.

-- Real life --

You will be given the certificate server binary file 'challenge'. You
can run the server in a standalone terminal. Consider this terminal as
a physical machine with a console text screen printing logs. You are
attacking in blackbox. Do not try to reverse engineer the 'challenge'
binary. You will waste your time ...
